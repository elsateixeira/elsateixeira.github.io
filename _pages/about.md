After a concluding an [undergraduate](https://fenix.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/degrees/fisica-564500436615320?_ga=2.149328766.995699073.1675884816-780358488.1675884816) in Physics followed by a [master's degree](https://fenix.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/degrees/fisica-564500436615316?_ga=2.80843743.995699073.1675884816-780358488.1675884816) in Physics with specialisation in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Lisbon, I am currently at the final stages of a PhD at the School of Mathematics and Statistics ([SoMaS](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths)) at the University of Sheffield in Sheffield, UK started in 2019. You can find more information on my detailed CV [here](files/CV.pdf).

My research interests are centred on theoretical and observational cosmology, with a particular focus on addressing the current cosmological tensions. In this framework, I am an active member of the [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaboration.

Beside research, I am involved in several teaching activities. I have teaching experience in different topics at the [Physics Department of Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/df) [School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Shffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths). More detail can be found on the relevant tab of this website.

I am also interested in outreach and communication and I am currently working on a project for an illustration book about the Universe.

## Research interests

My research focuses mainly on proposing and testing models beyond the standard ΛCDM model of cosmology. Our understanding of the Universe is at a turning point with considerable disagreement between probes of the early and late stages of the Universe. Although part of these observational tensions may be attributed to systematic errors, their magnitude and persistence hint at signs of missing physics in the standard model of cosmology - the ΛCDM model
testing interacting dark energy (IDE) models. These stand as promising proposals to address the theoretical and observational problems in the Standard Model of Cosmology.

In this context I am interested in developing new and more efficient numerical data analysis and statistical tools and techniques, with the aim of access ing the full potential of the increasing number and accuracy of cosmological data being collected. This can be complemented with simulations for forecasts for future data, offering insight into potentially successful directions of investigation. This is essential for planning future surveys, assessing which fundamental physics properties they should probe and deciding between data analysis approaches.

One of the most robust and extensively studied observables is the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, a rich archaeological snapshot of the Universe’s early stages. Exploring novel ways to extract additional information from this cosmological landscape on different energy scales is a major endeavour in the community, motivated by the potential for exploring different regimes and epochs of the Universe. Developing theoretical approximations and numerical techniques to account for the cosmological evolution of different features of the CMB is crucial to establish their signatures through their characteristic physical processes. It could also clarify the impact of interacting dark energy models and modified gravity theories on these scenarios.
As part of the [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaboration I am investigating how future CMB missions could probe such effects, hopefully shedding some light on the nature of the cosmological tensions.
