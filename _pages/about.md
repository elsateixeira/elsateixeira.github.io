I am a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology based at [LUPM](https://www.lupm.in2p3.fr), in Montpellier, south of France.
After a [master's degree](https://fenix.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/degrees/fisica-564500436615316?_ga=2.80843743.995699073.1675884816-780358488.1675884816) in Physics with specialisation in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the University of Lisbon, I did my PhD in Astrophysics and Cosmology at the School of Mathematics and Statistics ([SoMaS](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths)) at the University of Sheffield in Sheffield, UK from 2019 to 2023. You can find more information here on my detailed [CV](files/CV.pdf), along with the manuscript of my [PhD thesis](files/thesis.pdf).

 My research focuses on the physics of the dark sector and on robust tests of the standard cosmological model. My work connects modelling to data analysis: I build theoretically motivated extensions of ΛCDM, study their distinctive signatures, and confront them with multi-probe observations to assess viability and degeneracies. I also work on understanding the current cosmic tensions and late-time anomalies in cosmological data and their relation to fundamental physics. Within the [Euclid collaboration](https://www.euclid-ec.org), I contribute to data analysis and likelihood developments relevant for joint weak-lensing and galaxy-clustering analyses.

Beside research, I am involved in several teaching activities. I have teaching experience in different topics at the [Physics Department of Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/df) and at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/maths). More detail can be found on the relevant tab of this website.

I am also interested in philosophy and outreach and communication in science. I am currently working on a project for an illustration book about the Universe.

## Research interests

My research focuses mainly on proposing and testing models beyond the standard ΛCDM model of cosmology. Our understanding of the Universe is at a turning point with considerable disagreement between probes of the early and late stages of the Universe. Although part of these observational tensions may be attributed to systematic errors, their magnitude and persistence hint at signs of missing physics in the standard model of cosmology - the ΛCDM model
testing interacting dark energy (IDE) models. These stand as promising proposals to address the theoretical and observational problems in the Standard Model of Cosmology.

In this context I am interested in developing new and more efficient numerical data analysis and statistical tools and techniques, with the aim of access ing the full potential of the increasing number and accuracy of cosmological data being collected. This can be complemented with simulations for forecasts for future data, offering insight into potentially successful directions of investigation. This is essential for planning future surveys, assessing which fundamental physics properties they should probe and deciding between data analysis approaches.

As part of the [*Euclid*](https://www.euclid-ec.org) collaboration I am investigating signatures of dark sector physics and degeneracies with consistency-breaking effects and modelling systematics in ΛCDM. I am currently the chair of the Early Career Committee and I co-lead a project on testing the distance duality relation with Euclid data and lead a project focused on cosmic tensions within Euclid's internal probes and also with external data.
