My research develops and tests physically motivated extensions of the dark sector and connects them to observable signatures in cosmology. A defining aspect of my profile is bridging **theory and data analysis**: translating covariant model building (background + perturbations, stability, degeneracies) into survey-ready predictions, implemented in Einstein–Boltzmann solvers and confronted with multi-probe data.

## Current themes

**Interacting / extended dark sector**
- Covariant coupled dark-energy models (conformal, disformal, kinetic interactions) and their signatures in distances, clustering and lensing.
- Controlled theoretical viability: stability conditions, parameter-space mapping, and degeneracy-breaking with complementary observables.

**Consistency tests and cosmic tensions**
- Distance-based consistency tests (e.g. distance duality) to distinguish genuine late-time dynamics from calibration or photon-propagation effects.
- Cross-probe diagnostics motivated by current multi-probe anomalies.

**Euclid and survey-readiness**
- Contributions to forecasts and likelihood development for joint weak-lensing + galaxy-clustering analyses.
- Focus on robust theoretical interpretation of extended models in analysis pipelines.

## Software and reproducibility

I develop and maintain open-source code for cosmological modelling and inference, including modifications and extensions of **CLASS** and analysis pipelines used for parameter inference. Selected repositories are linked on my GitHub profile.
