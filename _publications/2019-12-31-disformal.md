This work is based on a cosmological model in which dark energy is portrayed by a canonical scalar field, allowed to couple to the other species by means of a disformal transformation of the metric. We revisited and extended the studies present in the literature by assuming that the disformal function in the metric transformation can depend both on the scalar field itself and on its derivatives, encapsulating a wide variety of scalar-tensor theories. This generalisation also leads to new and richer phenomenology, explaining some of the features found in previously studied models. We presented the full background equations and performed a detailed dynamical analysis, from where new disformal fixed points were found, that translate into novel cosmological features. These include early scaling regimes between the coupled species and broader stability parameter regions. However, viable cosmological models seem to have suppressed disformal late-time contributions.
