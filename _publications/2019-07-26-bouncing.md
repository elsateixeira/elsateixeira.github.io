The aim of this work was to formally derive the covariant action for modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and find functionals f(R,G) that reproduce the Friedmann equation of a bouncing Universe. This is motivated and predicted by an effective description of Loop Quantum Cosmology, where the Big Bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce. For this purpose, we resorted to an effective field theory approach, through the so-called order reduction technique. This method leads to solutions perturbatively close to GR while discarding the extra degrees of freedom present in higher order theories of gravity. Consistently, we find that the results obtained generalise and encompass previous studies in the literature, concerning $f(R)$ and f(G) models.
