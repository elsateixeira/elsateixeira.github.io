In this work we have studied the so-called Dark D-Brane model. In this model the role of dark energy is played by a non-canonical DBI scalar field, motivated by String Theory arguments. The dark matter component is assumed to be a cold dark matter (perfect) fluid and interactions in the dark sector are allowed and imposed by the geometrical setting of the theory in question. We have extended previous studies by computing the full evolution of the system, resorting to our own modified version of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver CLASS. Additionally, we derived the equations for the first order perturbations of the theory, that allow for a complete analysis of the observational predictions of the model, such as the imprints on the large scale structures and the evolution of the primordial temperature anisotropies
