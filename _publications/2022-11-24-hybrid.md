In this study we have proposed a conformally coupled dark energy model, characterised by an interaction between a tachyon field and the dark matter sector. A detailed dynamical systems analysis of this cosmological setting reveals various novel scenarios, in contrast with the previously studied uncoupled model, for which there exists only one stable critical point that gives late-time acceleration of the Universe. We find the interesting possibility of the emergence of a new fixed point, which is an attractor of the system and a scaling solution, known to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem. However, we also find that, in order for the evolution to be cosmologically viable, there is the need of introducing one uncoupled dark matter source, dominant at early times.
