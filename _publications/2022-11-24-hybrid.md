The main goal of this project was to study a model in which both dark matter and dark energy have a common origin. In particular, we consider the case in which the dark sector is composed by two scalar fields related through a potential inspired by that of hybrid inflation potential. We performed a thorough study of the model's phenomenology and restricted the relevant parameter space to realise the dark sector evolution. After some approximations, we show that the model can be described as a system of a pressureless fluid coupled to a light scalar field. We discuss this setup's cosmological consequences and the observational signatures in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structures, hinting at possible ways in which the model could address the present cosmological tensions.
