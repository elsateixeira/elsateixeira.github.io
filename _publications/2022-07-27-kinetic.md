The purpose of this study was to investigate interacting dark energy models which allow for the kinetic term of the scalar field to couple to dark matter through a power-law interaction. The expansion evolution of such models is characterised by scaling solutions at early times, which are are known to alleviate the coincidence problem, followed by a late time period of accelerated expansion. We performed a thorough analysis of the phenomenology of the background evolution and of the linear scalar perturbations. This allows to identify measurable signatures of the coupling in the dark sector on the cosmic microwave background, the lensing potential auto-correlation and the matter power spectra. Additionally, we performed a parameter estimation analysis using data of cosmic microwave background temperature, polarisation and lensing, baryonic acoustic oscillations and supernovae. We concluded that the parameter regulating the strength of the coupling between the dark sectors is constrained to be of order $10^{-4}$. Finally, model selection analysis revealed no statistical preference between Î›CDM and the Kinetic model.
